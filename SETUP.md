# Setting up your Project

1) Open this assignment in visual studio code using the button at the top of the README file!

2) Navigate to the `Sketch.java` file and open it.

3) Scroll down to the very bottom method, called "Main". A "Run" command will appear above it. (it might take a minute for everything to load and for this to appear). Click the command.

You should see a bouncing ball! If not, get help.

## Saving your work

1) Make sure to save often! I use Ctrl-S on windows, you would use Cmd-S on apple computers.

2) To save your work to the cloud, look for the icon on the left that looks like some circles connected by lines. It will probably have a little yellow icon with a number on it - that is the number of changes you have made.
   
3) Type a message in the line that says "Message" that says what you have changed since your last backup. Click the "Commit" button. Once that finished, click the "Sync Changes" button. Ta-da! It is now in the cloud.
